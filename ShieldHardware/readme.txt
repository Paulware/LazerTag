    IR Tx leds should be rotated 90 degrees so they can be bent without shorting
    3V regulator LD33V has incorrect part in schematic.  Its a sparkfun part.
    Pinout was incorrectly for LM7805 regulator 
    Ready for reorder (not urgent)
    To assemble, shift LD part one pin, unused pin goes to first pin(VCC)
